# TED_Talks_Analysis
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I explore and analyze the intriguing world of TED Talks. This repository contains two main components: a Jupyter notebook (`ted_project.ipynb`) focused on data cleaning and analysis using Python, and an SQL database file (`ted_talks_db.sql`) used for advanced data querying and analysis.

## Overview
This project aims to uncover insights from the vast array of TED Talks, employing both Python and SQL to handle different aspects of data analysis. Through this work, I demonstrate my proficiency in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and leveraging SQL for complex data queries.

## `ted_project.ipynb` - Data Cleaning and Analysis with Python
This Jupyter notebook contains a detailed analysis of the TED Talks dataset. Here's what you can expect:

- Data Cleaning: Methods employed to clean and preprocess the data, ensuring accuracy and reliability for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and statistical analysis to uncover trends and patterns in TED Talks.
- Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
To view this notebook, simply navigate to the `ted_project.ipynb` file in this repository.

## `ted_talks_db.sql` - Data Analysis with SQL
This SQL database file encapsulates a structured query approach to analyze the TED Talks data. It includes:

- Complex Queries: Demonstrations of complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
- Data Relationships: Exploration of relationships within the data, utilizing joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
To explore this database, download `ted_talks_db.sql` and import it into your preferred SQL database management system.
